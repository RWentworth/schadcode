# Schadcode - Schadenfreude for Hash Functions

Here you may find proofs of concept illustrating how the techniques 
developed at
[https://www.131002.net/siphash/](https://www.131002.net/siphash/)
could have been realized in practice. The code presented here breaks
MurmurHash 2 and 3 in real-life situations, serving as a scary example
for how relatively easily countermeasures installed after the presentation
of the original "hashDoS" vulnerability by Klink and Waelde at 28C3 can be
circumvented, ultimately leading to valid DoS attacks on software being 
frequently used today. Find out more about the details
[here](http://emboss.github.com/blog/2012/12/14/breaking-murmur-hash-flooding-dos-reloaded/).

### Purpose

The intention is to raise the level of awareness and to demonstrate that 
the threat is clear and present, one with possibly severe consequences.
